// This file tells Rust that this folder is a module.
// A module is just a way to organize code into smaller pieces.
//
// Inside this folder we have two files:
//
// - handler.rs → contains the code that handles requests (the logic)
// - model.rs   → contains the data types (structs) used in requests and responses

pub mod handler;
pub mod model;
